## README for DPF Plugins ##

This folder contains audio plugins downloaded from https://github.com/DISTRHO/DPF-Plugins/releases

The plugins are separated by their type - ladspa plugins are in the ladspa folder, etc.
Check your host documentation to know where to place these files.
Note that most hosts support LADSPA or VST but not DSSI or LV2.


If your host is not listing these plugins, make sure the binaries you downloaded match your host architecture.
32bit plugins go into 32bit hosts, same for 64bit.
Some hosts are able to load plugins with different architecture, but that's the exception rather than the rule.

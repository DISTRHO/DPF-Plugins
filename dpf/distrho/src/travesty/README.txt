This folder contains a pure C VST3-compatible interface, codenamed "travesty".
Name is a play on words from morphing "vestige" (the good old free VST2 reverse-engineered header file) and "three".

The main target is to be able to create VST3-compatible plugins without a bloated SDK.
Everything that is required for plugins fits in a few small header files as presented here.
Also being able to build VST3-compatible plugins in pure C code, something not possible with the original SDK.

Please note this project is still a work in progress.
Use at your own risk, and please report any issues to https://github.com/DISTRHO/DPF/.

# SYNOPSIS
#
#   AX_C_VAR_FUNC
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   This macro tests if the C complier supports the C9X standard __func__
#   identifier.
#
#   The new C9X standard for the C language stipulates that the identifier
#   __func__ shall be implicitly declared by the compiler as if, immediately
#   following the opening brace of each function definition, the declaration
#
#     static const char __func__[] = "function-name";
#
#   appeared, where function-name is the name of the function where the
#   __func__ identifier is used.
